# TOP-substrings
- Search text for words in a dictionary
- Count the occurences
- Return a hash with the found words as a key, and their respective occurences as a value

# Assignment:
'Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.'

# Note
#scan, #tally are great for this, but are not available pre-2.7.
